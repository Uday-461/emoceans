    content: `Most people come into therapy with a quiet hope.

They don't always say it out loud, but it sounds something like:

"I want to feel lighter."
"I want to stop repeating the same patterns."
"I want to finally be okay."

And for a while, things might feel… underwhelming.

Not worse. Not better. Just quieter. Slower. Less dramatic.

And that's often when a very painful thought shows up:

"Maybe therapy isn't working."
"Maybe I'm not improving."
"Maybe nothing can really help me."

As a therapist, I see this moment a lot and I want to tell you something, honestly:

**Most people don't leave therapy because it isn't working. They leave because they don't realize what stage of the work they are actually in.**

So here is the missing map most people don't give you.

We are taught to think change looks like this:

You feel bad → you seek help → you feel better → your life improves.

That is true only if your emotional system was already standing on solid ground.

But many people didn't grow up on solid ground.

They grew up in emotional neglect, unstable homes, unsafe relationships, constant pressure, or environments where they had to grow up too fast. Their nervous system learned survival before it learned safety. Their emotional world was shaped by "get through the day," not "grow into yourself."

So when they come to therapy, they aren't starting from neutral.

They're starting from below it.

## The Three Zones of Change

I like to explain therapy progress using something I call Baseline to Bloom.

It has three zones.

### 1. The Deficit Zone (aka Just Surviving)

This is where many people begin, even if they look "high functioning" on the outside. Inside, life feels heavy. You may be constantly anxious, emotionally numb, exhausted, hyper-independent, or stuck in people-pleasing, overthinking, or self-doubt. Your body is in alert mode more than it is in rest mode.

Here, your system isn't trying to grow. It is trying to survive.

Therapy at this stage is not about transformation. It's about stabilizing the ground beneath your feet. And because this work is quite like learning emotional language, building safety, noticing patterns, creating boundaries, it can feel like "nothing is happening."

But something very important is happening: **You are being brought back to baseline.**

### 2. The Baseline Zone (aka Finding Your Footing)

This is the most misunderstood stage of therapy. You're no longer constantly drowning. But you're also not floating yet.

Life feels calmer, but not brighter. You react less, but you still feel tired. You understand yourself more, but you're not "free" yet.

It feels… neutral. This is the stage where many people think therapy has stalled. But in reality, this is the moment your system is finally safe enough to grow.

Imagine planting seeds in dry, cracked soil. No matter how good the seed is, it won't grow. Baseline is when the soil is finally soft enough for roots to form.

**Without this stage, there is no bloom.**

### 3. The Growth Zone (aka Thriving & Growing)

This is what most people imagine therapy will give them right away:

- Better relationships.
- Stronger boundaries.
- More confidence.
- Emotional resilience.
- A deeper sense of self-trust.

But this stage only becomes possible after your system is no longer in survival mode.

**You cannot bloom in a storm. You bloom when the ground is steady.**

Therapy doesn't change you like flipping a switch. It changes you like the seasons change a tree.

Slow. Quiet. Invisible at first.

Until one day you realize your reactions are softer, your choices are clearer, and your inner world feels less heavy than it once did.

That's not failure. That's foundational change.

---

So, if you are in the neutral stage right now — if therapy feels "not dramatic," you're more aware but not yet lighter, if life feels quieter but not brighter — you are not broken. You are not doing therapy wrong and there is nothing wrong with you.

You are likely standing on the most important step of the journey: **The place where roots are forming.**

And the roots are not visible, but they are everything.`,

    title: "This Is The Part Of Self-Love No One Talks About",
    excerpt: "You cannot pour love into yourself if you have never experienced what it feels like to be loved.",
    category: "Self-Growth",

    content: `The most controversial opinion I'm sharing as a therapist, so here is something radical not many will tell you:

We talk a lot about "self-love."

You know those pop-psychology terms like fill your own cup, choose yourself, be your own source.

To someone who has only experienced pain or neglect, these words sound "bogus."

Yes, these ideas sound empowering but there is something important we are not talking about enough:

**You cannot pour love into yourself if you have never experienced what it feels like to be loved** (which is a very common experience of people growing up in dysfunctional homes).

Self-love is not created in isolation. It is internalised love, which means that it is formed only after we have been loved in ways our body can actually feel.

Our sense of worth is not something we think our way into. It is something we absorb.

We learn "I am safe," "I matter," "I am worthy" only when someone consistently shows us these truths through presence, protection, attunement, and care.

So what happens to people who did not receive this?

They grow up with emotional hunger, not because they are broken, but because they are emotionally under-nourished.

And then the world tells them: "Just love yourself."

So for many, this does not feel empowering. It feels confusing. It feels like "scam" (a word most of my clients have used).

And I agree.

**You cannot create emotional water by imagination alone. The cup does not produce water; it learns to hold water after it has been poured into.**

This is why modern self-love culture, when offered without context, can quietly turn healing into pressure. People begin to believe:

- "If I'm still empty, I failed."
- "If I still need others, I'm weak."
- "If I can't love myself yet, I'm broken."

But maybe you are not flawed. Maybe you were simply not given what you needed to grow fully.

**Self-love does not come first. Connection does.**

Safe relationships, emotional attunement, consistency, being seen and chosen — these are not extras.

They are the soil in which self-love grows.

---

So if your cup feels empty, there is nothing wrong with you.

You may just be learning — perhaps for the first time — how to receive what you were never given.

And that is not a failure.

It is not regression.

It is not weakness.

And, it is definitely not dependence.

**It is repair.**

And repair always begins in a relationship — with safety, with presence, with someone who can sit with your nervous system long enough for it to remember what "enough" feels like.

Only then does self-love stop feeling like a slogan and start feeling like something real.`,

    title: "Anger Is Not The Problem. What You Were Never Taught Is.",
    excerpt: "Most of us grew up learning exactly two things about anger: It is bad, and it should be controlled.",
    category: "Emotions",
    readTime: "5 min read",
    color: "var(--bleu-oxford)",
    content: `Most of us grew up learning exactly two things about anger:

1. It is bad.
2. It should be controlled.

We were told to calm down, behave, be mature, be quiet, and be nice. We were rarely taught what to do with anger — only what not to do.

And yet, if you grew up in an Indian household, you probably saw anger all the time.

Angry fathers. Irritated mothers. Raised voices, slammed doors, silent treatments, sharp words that landed heavier than they should have.

But what you probably didn't see much of were parents who openly showed sadness. Or shame. Or embarrassment. Or grief. Or fear. Or vulnerability. Or failure.

In many families, anger became the only "acceptable" emotion. Because anger looks strong. It looks powerful. It looks in control.

Sadness, shame, fear, and hurt, on the other hand, look messy. They look weak. They look uncomfortable.

So all the softer emotions went underground — and anger became their spokesperson.

Which means many of us did not just grow up around anger. **We grew up learning that anger is how pain speaks.**

## Anger Is a Protector, Not an Enemy

As a therapist, here is what I want to tell you:

Anger is not your problem. It is your nervous system's bodyguard.

Anger rises when something feels unsafe, unfair, intrusive, dismissive, or overwhelming. It steps in when your boundaries are crossed, when your needs are ignored, when your dignity feels threatened.

It is not trying to ruin your relationships. **It is trying to protect you.**

And here is probably what you are missing:

The more you treat your anger like an enemy (suppress it, shame it, fear it) the louder it gets.

Because your mind does not hear shame as "be quiet." It hears shame as "danger is still here." So it keeps the alarm ringing.

This is why people who constantly say "I hate my anger" often feel the most out of control with it. Their system is still trying to be heard.

## Suppression is NOT Regulation

The truth is, most of us were not taught emotional regulation. We were taught emotional suppression.

Smile through it, adjust, compromise, be understanding, don't react — and don't create problems.

So anger had nowhere to go — and what has nowhere to go turns inward or explodes outward.

Some people become reactive, loud, impulsive, sharp.

Others become anxious, numb, exhausted, depressed, sick.

Same anger. Different exits.

The scary truth is: **your body will always find a way to express what your mind refuses to listen to.**

## What You Can Do

So, if you are trying to work on your emotions and make the angry part of you less reactive, here is what you can do.

**Stop treating anger like it is fire and start treating it like it is the smoke alarm.**

It tells you:

- Something matters.
- Something feels unfair.
- Something crossed a line.
- Something needs protection.

If your smoke alarm keeps ringing, the solution is not to smash the alarm. The solution is to check for smoke.

**Regulation is not about silencing anger. It is about understanding what it is trying to protect — and responding to that need.**

---

So, if you have made it this far in reading this, I want you to grab a paper and write the answer to:

**What is my anger protecting me from?**`,
